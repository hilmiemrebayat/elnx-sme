  1. 

## Test plan
For testing purposes, the users have a password that is identical to their name. Adapt the variables at the beginning of the script, if necessary (particularly admin_user and admin_password).

Currently, most test cases are skipped, because failing tests will probably timeout which takes a lot of time. Remove the lines with the command skip at the beginning of a test case to execute it.

1. Log in op pr011 via terminal met `vagrant ssh pr011` en voer dan de code `sudo /vagrant/test/runbats.sh` uit.
